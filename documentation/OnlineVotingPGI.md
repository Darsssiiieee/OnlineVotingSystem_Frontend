# Project General Information

Group Name: TRIO
Project Title: Online Voting System

## A. Problem Statement:
1. Accessibility and Inclusivity: Despite advancements in technology, many eligible voters still face barriers to participating in elections, such as lack of access to the internet or digital literacy. This research aims to investigate how the Online Voting System can be designed to ensure that all demographics, including the elderly and those in rural areas, can participate effectively.

## B. Project Description:


## C. Project Objectives:

To develop an online voting system to streamline various types of voting, e.g. Non-profit organization voting, surveys or polls, etc. with the following features:

1. Anonymize votes: the user can be anonymous when voting, preserving their privacy.
2. User authentication: the user can create an account to see their voting history.
3. Ballot Designing: The voters can get the basic information and background of the candidate. They’ll be able to see the 
   credibility of the candidate, prompting them to make an informed decision.
4. Mobile compatibility: voters are able to access the voting form using a mobile device. Not only is this feature convenient, but some voters don't have access to it on their desktops or laptops
5. User-friendly interface: simple is better than complex. A minimal interface is more appealing than having a ton of UI elements.
6. Confidentiality and Integrity: online voting system faces critical challenges in ensuring confidentiality to protect voter identities and choices from unauthorized access, as well as integrity to guarantee that votes are accurately cast, counted, and reported without tampering, thereby maintaining public trust in the democratic process.
